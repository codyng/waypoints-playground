# Waypoints-playground

#### This project is ended.

## Story
The project was originally a challenge from **LALAMOVE (HK)**.

It is a **joke** because they did not focus on the result of the project itself such as the usability, correctness of usage of Google Map API, responsive layout, UI/UX, etc.
What they concerned, instead, was the fact how you set up the project and how you handles the warnings (non-critical warnings).

It seems that they are seeking a perfect coder who is supposed to know their coding habits or styles.

In my opinions, if you have experience on developing mobile Apps with React Native, there are tons of warnings from other 3rd libraries when you compile it. We can't handle all these warnings.

Moreover, they guy who made comments was not familiar with React and even create-react-app, and I didn't see any positive feedback towards the challenges.

***Feedback from LALAMOVE was like judging a book by its cover.***

## Problem of their APIs

#### Inconsistent HTTP responses

For all non-500 status, it is a JSON, which is fine.
For 500 HTTP status, it is a text.

I am not sure if they want to test the challengers.

## Live demo
https://waypoints-playground.web.app/

Details of Source code implementation are all removed because they did not know anything about Redux, Material-ui, etc.... because they didn't concern the frontend UX.
